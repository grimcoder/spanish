### Day 7: Basic Sentence Structure and Review of Week 1
Today, we'll focus on constructing basic sentences in Spanish and review the material we've covered during the first week.

#### Key Points:
**Basic Sentence Structure (Estructura básica de oraciones)**

Subject + Verb + Object (SVO)

**Example:** Yo (I) + soy (am) + feliz (happy) -> "Yo soy feliz."  
**Negation:** Simply add "no" before the verb.  

**Example:** Yo no soy feliz (I am not happy).  

**Questions:** Questions can often be formed by reversing the subject and the verb and adding question marks.

**Example:** ¿Eres tú feliz? (Are you happy?)  

**Review:**
* Greetings and Farewells: Hola, adiós, buenos días, etc.
* The Alphabet and Pronunciation: Basics of how to read Spanish.
* Numbers: 0-20 and the tens.
* Common Phrases: ¿Cómo te llamas?, Mucho gusto, etc.
* Telling Time and Basic Questions: ¿Qué hora es?, ¿Dónde está?, etc.
* Subject Pronouns and "Ser": Yo soy, tú eres, él es, etc.

#### Exercises for Today:
* Listening: Listen to some sample conversations in Spanish that use the basic sentence structure. YouTube is a great resource for this.
* Speaking: Try to create basic sentences using the SVO structure. Also, attempt to form questions and negations.
* Writing: Write down some sample sentences that you've created. Test out your knowledge by reviewing the past week's material.
* Review Exercise: Go through all the material learned from Days 1-6. Try to form sample dialogues using the vocabulary and structures you've learned.
